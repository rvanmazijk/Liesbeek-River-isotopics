This is an open access repository for data-sets and analyses for publication in review in *Water SA*

## How to replicate our results

In R, run each of the R-scripts (in `analyses/`).

These scripts automatically call on `setup.R`, to install all the required packages (with [`pacman`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html)), define our own functions, and load all our data as needed. The exact versions and sources of all the packages we used have been documented by [`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/), a dependency manager for R-projects.

Figures appear as TIFF-files in the working directory, while other outputs appear on the R-console.

Note, `uncertainty-propagation.Rmd` is an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document, showing the arithmetic behind how we propagated analytical uncertainty in our mass-balance model (to determine rainfall contribution to Liesbeek River storm-flow). It is viewable [here](https://rvanmazijk.github.io/Liesbeek-River-isotopics/analyses/uncertainty-propagation.pdf).
