This is an open access repository for data-sets and analyses for publication in review in *Water SA*

## How to replicate our results

In R, run each of the R-scripts the `analyses/` in the order numbered. 

These scripts automatically call on `setup.R`, to install all the required packages (with [`pacman`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html)), source other code in `functions/`, and load all our data as needed.

Figures should appear in `figures/`, while other outputs appear on the console

Please also see the documentation of our mass-balance model's calculations and uncertainty propagations [here](rvanmazijk.github.io/Liesbeek-River-isotopics/analyses/uncertainty-propagation.html).
